## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Marcos. 

With two decades of experience as a UI designer and developer, I specialize in design systems bridging the gap between design and development. I focus on creating collaborative environments and developing tools and workflows that enhance productivity and accessibility. Additionally, I am an educator, local leader of IXDA Mar del Plata (Argentina), Figma plugins creator, and a great goalkeeper.
